## Python - A few bunch of codes And Materials


A repository to organise a lot of materials that i've been used, that I use and that I will use someday (maybe). Most part of these materials were not provided by me, which mean that I am not the owner/creator ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Hope you enjoy it



**Still, some code in R due to the incompatibility of some modules in Python for the version I use**
